## WHY?

- TS is superset of JS
- Code faces less error in run time
- It helps to reduce the error in run time
- Typescript improves project quality
- Compiled in JS
- Type safety
  - eg: 2 + "2" = "22"
- Static checking : Analyze the code as we type.

TS - compiled/transpiled - JS
Helps the better code with less errors.
